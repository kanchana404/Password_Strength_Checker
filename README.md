🔐 Excited to Share: Simple Password Strength Checker Project 🔐



I'm thrilled to share a small project I've been working on—a simple password strength checker. While it might seem basic, it's a stepping stone toward understanding more complex security concepts.

What does it do? 🤔

This project checks the strength of passwords based on their length. It's a fundamental aspect of password security.

Why share it here? 🌟

I believe in the power of sharing and learning from one another. By showcasing even the smallest projects, we can inspire others to explore programming and security.

How to Use:

Input a password.
The checker will evaluate its strength based on length.
It's a reminder of how even the simplest measures can contribute to better security practices.

This project is just the beginning. I'm eager to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas for improvement. Let's collaborate and learn together!
